 Repository for fish microbiome work (16S)
This repository holds code for processing 16S sequences of fish skin and gut microbiome samples collected from tropical reef fish in Panama, as well as associated environmental water samples. 
Current samples were collected in 2021-22 by members of the Rohr Reef Resilience project at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
